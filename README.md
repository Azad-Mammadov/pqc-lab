# pqc-lab: Post-Quantum Cryptography Lab

This is a personal lab and knowledge base focused on researching and experimenting with post-quantum cryptography (PQC). My aim is to explore quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, implement prototypes, and develop a new concept called **CrypTon** — a potential future method for secure communication in a post-quantum world.

## 🔍 Focus Areas
- Lattice-based cryptography (e.g., Kyber, NTRU)
- Hash-based signatures (e.g., SPHINCS+)
- Multivariate and code-based cryptosystems
- Quantum attack models
- CrypTon: A novel encryption concept

## 💡 Project Goals
- Learn and implement PQC algorithms
- Develop CrypTon prototype
- Share research findings via blog posts
- Contribute to the open discussion on quantum-era security

## 📚 Blog Series
- [CrypTon: The Birth of a Post-Quantum Cipher](https://medium.com/@azadmammadov)
- More coming soon...

## 📂 Structure
See folder descriptions in the repo for each stage of development.
